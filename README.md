## 🌟 About Me

I'm Vanshika, a Software Engineering undergrad at DTU.
I’m passionate about turning ideas into code, exploring new technologies, and making sense of complex problems. Always up for a challenge, whether it’s a hackathon, a new framework, or figuring out why my code worked yesterday but not today.

🛠️ **Currently working with:**
- HTML, CSS, C, C++, Python, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Netlify, Vercel, Render, Streamlit, Anaconda, AWS, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Interested in cloud deployment, data-driven apps, and automation.
